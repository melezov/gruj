      <h2>What is GRUJ?</h2>
      <p>
        GRUJ (gr&#x28c;d&#x292;) is an application which downloads and launches jar files.
        Its primary function is to reduce the <em>binary footprint</em> of source
        versioned projects and releases to a minimum, due to its tiny size (~3kb).
      </p>
      <p>
        GRUJ was written in Jasmin, and the source code is freely available.
        <a class="ninja" href="http://unlicense.org/" rel="external">
          This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

      <h2>Why use GRUJ?</h2>
      <p>
        Although there are many cross-platform tools that would do the job, such as wget,
        curl and similar the main problem is that none of these is available by default
        on all platforms.<br/>
        Since GRUJ is primarily designed to bootstrap other Java programs,
        the only thing you need is a JRE itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Same goes for calculating checksums. Again, there is a lot of tools available,
        but if you want to write a bash/batch script and make sure it's solid, you need
        to make sure that whatever digest engine you used is already installed.<br/>
        GRUJ can double as a poor man's checksum verifier, since it can generate MD5
        and SHA-1 hashes. In short &ndash; it's a couple of simple functions related
        to downloading and verifying wrapped in one small package.

      <h2>How does GRUJ work?</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Check to see if file was already downloaded before
          <ul>
            <li>optionally check the cached file against a checksum</li>
            <li>optionally delete the invalidated file on checksum mismatch</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          If file did not exist, download it from the provided URL
          <ul>
            <li>optionally compare the newly downloaded file to a checksum</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Run the jar file by invoking its main-class method
          <ul>
            <li>optionally run a different main method</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
