      <h3>Using GRUJ as a glorified poor man's download manager</h3>
      <p>
        When plain ol' download managers don't cut it, you need the power
        of Java connector libraries to tap into them weird astral protocol planes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take gopher for example :)<br/>

      <p>
        What we're going to do now is just use GRUJ to download the jar file,
        but let's not actually run it, to keep things simple. This is done via the <strong>-m</strong> switch
        like it was shown on the <a href="/examples/executing-jars">"Executing jars"</a> example.

        Fun example of using the file protocol for executing jars:

        That's about it for now! Be sure to <a href="mailto:marko@element.hr">contact me</a> if you find
        some exotic usage and I'll add it to the list.
