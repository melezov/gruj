      <h3>Using GRUJ as a glorified download manager</h3>
      <h4>&lt;work in progress&gt;</h4>
      <p>
        When plain ol' download managers don't cut it, you need the power
        of Java to tap into them weird astral protocol planes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take gopher for example :)<br />

      </p>
      <p>
        What we're going to do now is just use GRUJ to download the jar file,
        but let's not actually run it. By setting the &quot;<em>-m</em>&quot; argument
        we are effectively overriding the main-class to run and therefore GRUJ will
        promptly exit after the file has been downloaded.
